# Starbucks promotion exercise

### Summary
This project is a recommendation exercise provided by Starbucks.
The goal is to investigate customers receptiveness towards promotion for a product.
The setup is very simplified. There is no time dependency and only one product considered.
It covers training and test data of customers with their specifics and the information whether a promotion was sent and the product bought afterwards.
A full description of the problem setting is provided in the main jupyter file.

### Motivation
This project covers a simple real life problem of shops, restaurants, or cafÃ©s in how to advertise the right customers that are willing to pay for offered products.
From their specifics one can learn how to improve the intuition in marketing campaigns.

### Data sources: 

### Install/run instructions:
1. Install python >= 3.11 and the packages denoted in requirements_working_configuration.txt preferably in a virtual environment as exemplarily shown for the windows command prompt:
```
      projectfolder:> python -m venv .venv
      projectfolder:> cd .venv\Scripts
      projectfolder\.venv\Scripts> .\activate.bat
      projectfolder\.venv\Scripts> cd ..\..
      projectfolder:> python -m pip install -r requirements_working_configuration.txt
```
      Within your project folder "projectfolder" use the "python" command as long as the virtual environment is activated
      (if not working with/on the project, the virtual environment should be deactivated by executing projectfolder\.venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat).

      Important note: If you are using requirements.txt (no package versions provided) instead of requirements_working_configuration.txt, make shure to install ipykernel before (python -m pip install ipykernel). The order seems important.

2. In the programming IDE select .venv\Scripts\python.exe as Kernel.

1. Run all code blocks in "Starbucks.ipynb"
